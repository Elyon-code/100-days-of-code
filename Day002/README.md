## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the total bill amount.
2. They choose a tip percentage (10%, 12%, 15%, etc.).
3. The calculator computes the total tip and adds it to the bill.
4. The user then enters how many people will split the bill.
5. The program outputs how much each person should pay.
